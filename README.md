# FHIR Patient Management App

This is a simple web application for managing patient records, interacting with a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) server. It provides a user-friendly interface to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on patient information.

## üöÄ Features

  * **Patient Listing:** Displays a paginated list of patients fetched from the FHIR server.
  * **Patient Search:** Efficiently search for patients using various criteria:
      * By Name (partial match)
      * By Phone Number
      * By Date of Birth
      * By FHIR ID
  * **Create Patient:** Intuitive form to add new patient records with essential demographic details.
  * **Update Patient:** Seamlessly edit existing patient information. Clicking "Edit" on a patient's row transforms the creation form into an update form, pre-filling it with the patient's current data.
  * **Delete Patient:** Securely remove patient records from the system.
  * **Pagination:** Navigate through large datasets with "Previous" and "Next" page controls.
  * **Responsive Design:** A clean and basic responsive layout powered by Tailwind CSS.

## üì¶ Technologies Used

  * **Backend:**
      * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): JavaScript runtime.
      * [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/): Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
      * [Axios](https://axios-http.com/): Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js, used for FHIR API interaction.
      * [CORS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors): Node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
      * [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv): Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
  * **Frontend:**
      * HTML5
      * CSS3 ([Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)): A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
      * JavaScript (Vanilla JS): Client-side scripting for dynamic interactions.
  * **FHIR Server:**
      * Configurable via `.env`, typically integrates with a public test server like `https://fhir-bootcamp.medblocks.com/fhir/` or `http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version recommended)
  * [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm) (comes with Node.js)

### 1\. Project Structure

Make sure your project files are organized as follows:

```
patient-manager-app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ fhirService.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env.example
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ server.js
```

### 2\. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the root directory of your project in your terminal and run the following command to install all necessary Node.js packages:

```bash
npm install express cors axios dotenv
```

### 3\. Configure Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project. This file will store the base URL for the FHIR server you intend to use.

**Example `.env` file:**

```env
FHIR_BASE_URL=https://fhir-bootcamp.medblocks.com/fhir/
PORT=3000
```

  * You can also use `FHIR_BASE_URL=http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4` for the public HAPI FHIR test server.
  * `PORT` is optional; it defaults to `3000` if not specified.

### 4\. Run the Application

Start the Node.js server from the root directory of your project:

```bash
node server.js
```

Upon successful startup, you will see output similar to this in your terminal:

```
Server running on http://localhost:3000
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to access the application.
```

### 5\. Access the Application

Open your web browser and navigate to the URL displayed in the console, typically:

```
http://localhost:3000
```
